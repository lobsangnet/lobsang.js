### Reporting a bug

Even if you can't write code, you can still report bugs.

_First make sure it wasn't reported, yet._

Basically it consists of these three parts:

1. Steps to Reproduce: What exact steps are needed to observe the problem?
2. Expected behaviour: What did you expect to happen?
3. Actual behaviour: What happened instead?

Fear not, there will be some pre-filled text to help you fill in the blanks :-)

### I am not good with tech

Can you do translations? It's planned to keep the packages translatable, so
if you speak a language other than English, please get in touch with us!

### I am a techie

We can need your help then :-)

This project makes deliberatively no use of a typed compile step.
If you would to code in TypeScript or Flowtype, please open an issue.
We might create a dedicated repository for it.
